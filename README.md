# RDD Replication Package

# All output files are saved in the SAME folder as the scripts!
No subfolders, no complicated directory structure. Everything in one place.

### 💡 Executive Summary
The Problem: Standard aggregate metrics often hide critical variations. 
             This project proves that default statistical models (Pooled RDD) implicitly weight data based on sample density rather than actual strategic importance, leading to skewed conclusions.
The Data:Processed, cleaned, and analyzed large-scale longitudinal datasets (U.S. House elections, 1946-1992) using R, managing complex regional and temporal variables. 
The Insight: By building a custom framework to re-weight the data based on true population impact, I demonstrated that default aggregated results were skewed by up to 38%. 
Business Takeaway:Relying on default metric dashboards without understanding their underlying data assumptions can lead to severely flawed strategic decisions. 
                  Custom weighting based on actual business objectives is crucial.

## 📁 Project Structure


## 🚀 Quick Start

### Install R Packages
```r
install.packages(c("rdrobust", "dplyr", "tidyr", "readr", "ggplot2"))
```

### Run Analyses

```r
# Step 1: Basics
source("baseline.R")
source("population_take.R")
source("congress_take.R")

# Step 2: Heterogeneity
source("adabyyear.R") → Table A.1 & Figure A.1
source("adabystate.R") → Table A.2 & Figure A.2
source("dembyyear.R")  → Figure 1 & Table B.1 & Figure B.1
source("dembystate.R") → Figure 2 & Table B.2 & Figure B.2

# Step 3: Robustness
source("pool_bandwidth.R") → Figure C.1 & Table C.1 & Figure C.2 & Table C.2
source("pool_order.R") → Figure C.3 & Table C.3 & Figure C.4 & Table C.4
source("waldtest.R") → Table1

# Step 4: Weighting
source("population_state_weight_DEM_ADA.R")
source("population_year_weight_DEM_ADA.R")
source("state_weight.R") → Figure 4 & Figure D.3 & Table D.3 & Figure D.4 & Table D.4
source("year_weight.R") → Figure 3 & Figure D.1 & Table D.1 & Figure D.2 & Table D.2

# Step 5: Final
source("ada_implicit.R") → Figure E.3 & Figure E.4
source("dem_implicit.R") → Figure E.5
source("AppendixE.R") → Table E.1 & Figure E.1 & Figure E.2
```

# Level 1 (run first):
- baseline.R → creates `baseline_pooled_results.csv`
- adabyyear.R → creates `ada_by_year_detailed_results.csv`
- adabystate.R → creates `ada_by_state_detailed_results.csv`
- dembyyear.R → creates `democrat_by_year_detailed_results.csv`
- dembystate.R → creates `democrat_by_state_detailed_results.csv`

# Level 2 (need Level 1 files):
- pool_bandwidth.R, pool_order.R → need `baseline_pooled_results.csv`
- population_state_weight_DEM_ADA.R → needs state analysis results
- population_year_weight_DEM_ADA.R → needs year analysis results

# Level 3 (need Level 2 files):
- year_weight.R → needs year analyses + population weighting results
- ada_implicit.R → needs state analyses + population weighting results
- dem_implicit.R → needs state analyses + population weighting results

# Level 4 (needs many files):
- AppendixE.R → needs year and state analyses
